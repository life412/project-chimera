# Agentic Commerce Summary

# OpenClaw Integration

Chimera agents publish availability and supported skills to the OpenClaw network.

Each agent exposes:
- Agent name
- Supported skills
- Input/output contracts
- Current availability state

This allows external orchestrators to discover and route tasks dynamically.
